# Pocket Portals Architecture

**Version 1.0 | Extreme Programming + BDD Edition**

---

## XP Principles Applied

This architecture embraces Extreme Programming values throughout:

| XP Value | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simplicity** | Do the simplest thing that could possibly work. No speculative features. |
| **Feedback** | Fast cycles: user input → agent response → user choice. Continuous learning. |
| **Communication** | Agents communicate intent via annotations. Code communicates via tests. |
| **Courage** | Delete code that isn't working. Refactor mercilessly. Ship early. |
| **Respect** | Respect user time (60s to adventure). Respect token budgets. Respect constraints. |

---

## BDD Principles Applied

Behavior-Driven Development ensures we build what users actually need:

| BDD Concept | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Ubiquitous Language** | "Adventure", "Quest", "Tavern" — domain terms used everywhere |
| **Outside-In** | Start with user behavior, work inward to implementation |
| **Living Documentation** | Feature files ARE the specification |
| **Three Amigos** | User story, agent behavior, and test all align |
| **Given-When-Then** | Every scenario follows this structure |

## 2. XP Practice: Simple Design

### The Simplest Thing That Works

**What we build:**
- Single FastAPI application (monolith)
- In-memory session state (dict per session)
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming for real-time narrative delivery
- CrewAI for agent orchestration
- Character-by-character streaming via `agent_chunk` SSE events
- SQLite for adventure logs (if persistence needed)

**What we DON'T build (yet):**
- Microservices
- Redis/external cache
- WebSocket complexity
- User accounts/auth
- Database for session state
- Frontend JavaScript framework

### Four Rules of Simple Design

1. **Passes all tests** → Every agent output validated by Keeper
2. **Reveals intention** → Agent annotations explain reasoning
3. **No duplication** → Shared tools, single source of truth for world state
4. **Fewest elements** → Minimal agent count that delivers value

---

## 3. XP Practice: Incremental Design

### Walking Skeleton (Week 1)

The thinnest possible slice through all layers:

```
User Input → FastAPI → Single Agent (Narrator) → Streaming Response → UI
```

**Deliverable:** User types "A grumpy dwarf fighter" → Gets narrative response streamed to screen.

**No:**
- Character sheet generation
- Multiple agents
- Dice rolling
- Choices/branching

### Iteration 1: Character Creation (Week 2)

```
User Input → Character Interviewer Agent → Character Sheet → UI Review
```

**Add:**
- Character Interviewer agent (interactive character creation)
- Character sheet Pydantic model
- Accept/modify UI flow
- Session state integration for character data

### Iteration 2: Quest Generation (Week 3)

```
Character Sheet → Innkeeper Agent → Quest Hook → Narrator Agent → Scene 1
```

**Add:**
- Innkeeper agent
- Quest personalization from backstory
- World state initialization

### Iteration 3: Gameplay Loop (Week 4)

```
Scene → Choices → User Input → Narrator Response → Consequence Tracking
```

**Add:**
- Branching choices
- World state updates
- Jester interventions

### Iteration 4: Combat & Resolution (Week 5)

```
Combat Trigger → Initiative → Turn Loop → Resolution → Epilogue
```

**Add:**
- Dice tools
- HP tracking
- Combat state machine
- Epilogue generation

## 4. XP Practice: Test-First Development

### Test Pyramid for AI Agents

```
         ╱╲
        ╱  ╲         E2E Tests (few)
       ╱────╲        Full adventure playthrough
      ╱      ╲
     ╱────────╲      Integration Tests (some)
    ╱          ╲     Agent → Tools → Output validation
   ╱────────────╲
  ╱              ╲   Unit Tests (many)
 ╱────────────────╲  Tools, schemas, state management
```

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests (fast, many):**
```python
# test_dice.py
def test_roll_d20_returns_valid_range():
    result = dice_roller.roll("1d20")
    assert 1 <= result.total <= 20

def test_character_sheet_validates_stats():
    with pytest.raises(ValidationError):
        CharacterSheet(strength=25)  # Max is 20
```

**Integration Tests (medium speed, some):**
```python
# test_agents.py
def test_chronicler_validates_combat_action():
    action = CombatAction(type="attack", target="goblin", roll=15)
    result = chronicler.validate(action, character_sheet)
    assert result.is_valid
    assert result.damage > 0

def test_dm_generates_scene_with_character_context():
    character = CharacterSheet(name="Grimlock", backstory="Lost his clan")
    scene = dm.generate_scene(character, quest_hook)
    assert "clan" in scene.lower() or "loss" in scene.lower()
```

**E2E Tests (slow, few):**
```python
# test_adventure.py
def test_complete_adventure_flow():
    session = create_session()

    # Character creation
    character = session.create_character("A vengeful tiefling warlock")
    assert character.class_ == "Warlock"

    # Quest hook
    quest = session.get_quest_hook()
    assert quest.relates_to(character.backstory)

    # Make choices through adventure
    for _ in range(5):
        choices = session.get_choices()
        session.choose(choices[0])

    # Epilogue
    epilogue = session.get_epilogue()
    assert epilogue.references_choices_made()
```

### Mocking Strategy

```python
# Expensive: Real Claude API calls
# Cheap: Recorded responses for deterministic tests

@pytest.fixture
def mock_claude():
    with vcr.use_cassette("character_creation.yaml"):
        yield

def test_character_creation_with_recorded_response(mock_claude):
    result = character_crew.analyze("A sneaky halfling rogue")
    assert result.class_ == "Rogue"
```

## 5. BDD Practice: Feature Specifications

### Gherkin Feature Files

All user-facing behavior is specified in Gherkin before implementation:

```gherkin
# features/character_creation.feature

Feature: Character Creation
  As a solo adventurer
  I want to describe my character in plain English
  So that I can start an adventure without complex forms

  Background:
    Given I am at the tavern entrance
    And the Innkeeper is ready to greet me

  @P0 @happy-path
  Scenario: Create character from description
    When I describe my character as "A grumpy dwarf fighter who lost his clan to orcs"
    Then the Keeper should generate a character sheet
    And the character class should be "Fighter"
    And the character race should be "Dwarf"
    And the backstory should reference "clan" and "orcs"
    And I should see the character sheet within 30 seconds

  @P0 @validation
  Scenario: Character stats are valid D&D 5e
    When I describe my character as "An elderly wizard"
    Then all ability scores should be between 3 and 18
    And the total ability score points should follow standard array or point buy
    And the character level should be 1

  @P0 @modification
  Scenario: Modify generated character
    Given the Keeper has generated my character sheet
    When I modify my character name to "Grimlock Stonefist"
    And I accept the character
    Then my adventure should begin with that name
    And the Innkeeper should address me as "Grimlock"

  @P1 @edge-case
  Scenario: Handle vague character description
    When I describe my character as "someone cool"
    Then the Keeper should ask clarifying questions
    And I should see suggested character concepts
```

```gherkin
# features/quest_generation.feature

Feature: Personalized Quest Generation
  As a solo adventurer
  I want quests tailored to my character's backstory
  So that my adventure feels personal and meaningful

  @P0 @personalization
  Scenario: Quest hooks into backstory
    Given I have a character with backstory "Seeking revenge for my murdered sister"
    When the Innkeeper introduces a quest
    Then the quest should reference family, loss, or revenge
    And an NPC should have connection to my backstory

  @P0 @variety
  Scenario Outline: Different backstories get different quests
    Given I have a character with backstory "<backstory>"
    When the Innkeeper introduces a quest
    Then the quest theme should match "<expected_theme>"

    Examples:
      | backstory                          | expected_theme     |
      | Exiled from my homeland            | redemption/return  |
      | Hunting a legendary monster        | hunt/tracking      |
      | Searching for a lost artifact      | discovery/treasure |
      | Fleeing from a dark past           | pursuit/secrets    |

  @P0 @npcs
  Scenario: Quest introduces memorable NPC
    Given I have accepted a quest
    When I meet the quest-giver NPC
    Then the NPC should have a distinct personality
    And the NPC should have a name
    And the NPC should remember my character's name
```

```gherkin
# features/gameplay_loop.feature

Feature: Interactive Adventure Gameplay
  As a solo adventurer
  I want meaningful choices that affect my story
  So that my adventure feels like real D&D

  @P0 @choices
  Scenario: Branching narrative choices
    Given I am in an active scene
    When the Narrator presents a decision point
    Then I should see 3-4 predefined choices
    And I should have an option for custom input
    And each choice should have visible consequences

  @P0 @consequences
  Scenario: Choices have lasting effects
    Given I chose to "spare the bandit leader"
    When I encounter related NPCs later
    Then they should reference my earlier choice
    And the world state should reflect my decision

  @P0 @custom-input
  Scenario: Handle unexpected player actions
    Given the Narrator presents choices: Attack, Negotiate, Flee
    When I type "I try to seduce the dragon"
    Then the Narrator should acknowledge my creative choice
    And the Keeper should determine if a roll is needed
    And the narrative should continue coherently

  @P1 @jester
  Scenario: Jester adds complications
    Given I am progressing smoothly through the adventure
    When a scene has been calm for 3 exchanges
    Then the Jester may introduce a complication
    And I should see a Jester annotation
    And the complication should be narratively appropriate
```

```gherkin
# features/combat.feature

Feature: Turn-Based Combat
  As a solo adventurer
  I want tactical combat with real dice rolls
  So that battles feel exciting and consequential

  @P0 @initiative
  Scenario: Combat begins with initiative
    Given I encounter hostile enemies
    When combat begins
    Then the Keeper should roll initiative for all combatants
    And I should see the turn order displayed
    And the highest initiative should act first

  @P0 @dice-rolls
  Scenario: Attack with dice mechanics
    Given it is my turn in combat
    When I choose to attack an enemy
    Then the Keeper should roll a d20 for attack
    And I should see the dice result with animation
    And if the roll meets or exceeds AC, damage should be rolled
    And the Narrator should narrate the outcome

  @P0 @damage
  Scenario: Track HP and damage
    Given I have 25 HP
    When an enemy hits me for 8 damage
    Then my HP should be reduced to 17
    And I should see my updated HP displayed
    And the Narrator should describe the hit narratively

  @P0 @death
  Scenario: Character reaches 0 HP
    Given I have 3 HP
    When an enemy hits me for 10 damage
    Then I should fall unconscious
    And the Keeper should explain death saving throws
    And the adventure should handle defeat gracefully

  @P2 @battlefield
  Scenario: ASCII battlefield visualization
    Given combat has multiple combatants
    When I view the battlefield
    Then I should see an ASCII grid showing positions
    And my character should be marked distinctly
    And enemies should show remaining HP indicators
```

```gherkin
# features/epilogue.feature

Feature: Adventure Conclusion
  As a solo adventurer
  I want a personalized ending that reflects my journey
  So that my adventure feels complete and memorable

  @P0 @epilogue
  Scenario: Generate personalized epilogue
    Given I have completed the main quest
    When the adventure concludes
    Then the Narrator should generate an epilogue
    And the epilogue should reference my key choices
    And the epilogue should mention NPCs I befriended or opposed
    And the tone should match my adventure's outcome

  @P0 @character-sheet
  Scenario: Final character sheet with achievements
    Given the adventure has concluded
    When I view my final character sheet
    Then I should see any XP or level gains
    And I should see notable achievements listed
    And I should see key relationships formed

  @P1 @export
  Scenario: Download adventure log
    Given the adventure has concluded
    When I click "Download Adventure Log"
    Then I should receive a markdown file
    And the file should contain the full narrative
    And the file should include my character sheet
    And the file should list my choices and outcomes
```

### Step Definitions Structure

```python
# tests/bdd/steps/character_steps.py

from behave import given, when, then
from pocket_portals.schemas import CharacterSheet


@given("I am at the tavern entrance")
def step_at_tavern(context):
    context.session = create_test_session()
    context.location = "tavern_entrance"


@when('I describe my character as "{description}"')
def step_describe_character(context, description):
    context.character_input = description
    context.character = context.session.create_character(description)


@then("the Keeper should generate a character sheet")
def step_chronicler_generates(context):
    assert context.character is not None
    assert isinstance(context.character, CharacterSheet)


@then('the character class should be "{expected_class}"')
def step_verify_class(context, expected_class):
    assert context.character.class_ == expected_class


@then('the backstory should reference "{keyword1}" and "{keyword2}"')
def step_backstory_references(context, keyword1, keyword2):
    backstory = context.character.backstory.lower()
    assert keyword1.lower() in backstory or keyword2.lower() in backstory
```

```python
# tests/bdd/steps/combat_steps.py

from behave import given, when, then


@given("I encounter hostile enemies")
def step_encounter_enemies(context):
    context.enemies = context.session.spawn_enemies(count=2)


@when("combat begins")
def step_combat_begins(context):
    context.combat = context.session.start_combat(context.enemies)
    context.initiative_order = context.combat.roll_initiative()


@then("the Keeper should roll initiative for all combatants")
def step_initiative_rolled(context):
    assert len(context.initiative_order) == len(context.enemies) + 1


@then("I should see the turn order displayed")
def step_turn_order_visible(context):
    for combatant in context.initiative_order:
        assert combatant.initiative_roll is not None
        assert combatant.name is not None

### Running BDD Tests

```bash
# Run all BDD scenarios
make bdd

# Run specific feature
uv run behave tests/bdd/features/combat.feature

# Run by tag
uv run behave --tags=@P0           # Must-have features only
uv run behave --tags=@happy-path   # Happy path scenarios
uv run behave --tags=~@P2          # Exclude nice-to-have

```

### BDD + Agent Alignment

Each agent's behavior maps to specific Gherkin scenarios:

| Agent | Primary Features | Key Scenarios |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Character Interviewer | character_creation.feature | Interactive character creation, backstory elicitation |
| Innkeeper | quest_generation.feature | Quest hooks, NPC introductions |
| Narrator | gameplay_loop.feature, epilogue.feature | Scene generation, choices, endings |
| Keeper | combat.feature | Dice rolls, mechanics validation |
| Jester | gameplay_loop.feature | Complications, foreshadowing |

## 6. XP Practice: Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline (Every Push)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --all-extras

      - name: Lint
        run: uv run ruff check src/ tests/

      - name: Type check
        run: uv run mypy src/

      - name: Unit tests
        run: uv run pytest tests/unit -v

      - name: Integration tests
        run: uv run pytest tests/integration -v
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}

      - name: Coverage
        run: uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80

      - name: BDD Tests (P0 scenarios)
        run: uv run behave tests/bdd --tags=@P0
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Ten-Minute Build

**Target:** All tests complete in <10 minutes

**Strategy:**
- Parallel test execution
- Mock expensive API calls in unit tests
- Real API calls only in integration suite (with VCR recording)
- Skip E2E in CI (run nightly)

---

## 6. XP Practice: Pair Programming (Agent Edition)

### Agent Pairing Strategy

Every significant output involves two agents:

| Primary Agent | Pair Agent | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| Narrator | Jester | Narrator writes scene, Jester adds complications |
| Keeper | Narrator | Keeper validates mechanics, Narrator narrates outcome |
| Innkeeper | Narrator | Innkeeper hooks quest, Narrator develops it |

### Review Agent Pattern

```python
class AgentPair:
    """XP Pair Programming applied to AI agents."""

    def __init__(self, driver: Agent, navigator: Agent):
        self.driver = driver      # Generates content
        self.navigator = navigator # Reviews/validates

    def execute(self, task: Task) -> Output:
        draft = self.driver.execute(task)
        review = self.navigator.review(draft)

        if review.needs_revision:
            return self.driver.revise(draft, review.feedback)
        return draft
```

---

## 7. XP Practice: Collective Code Ownership

### Shared Components

No agent "owns" code. All agents share:

```
src/pocket_portals/
├── agents/           # Agent definitions (all can modify)
│   ├── innkeeper.py
│   ├── narrator.py
│   ├── chronicler.py
│   └── jester.py
│
├── tools/            # Shared tools (any agent can use)
│   ├── dice.py
│   ├── character_sheet.py
│   ├── world_state.py
│   └── combat.py
│
├── schemas/          # Shared data models
│   ├── character.py
│   ├── quest.py
│   ├── scene.py
│   └── combat.py
│
├── crew/             # Crew orchestration
│   ├── character_crew.py
│   └── adventure_crew.py
│
└── api/              # FastAPI endpoints
    ├── routes.py
    └── streaming.py
```

### Tool Ownership Matrix

| Tool | Primary User | Can Also Use |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| DiceRoller | Keeper | Narrator (narrative rolls) |
| WorldState | Narrator | All (read), Narrator (write) |
| CharacterSheet | Keeper | All (read) |
| CombatManager | Keeper | Narrator (narration) |

---

## 8. XP Practice: Sustainable Pace

### Token Budget Per Session

Sustainable API costs = sustainable development:

```python

## 11. XP Practice: Refactoring

### Refactoring Triggers

Refactor when you see:

| Smell | Refactoring |
|-------|-------------|
| Agent doing too much | Extract responsibilities to new agent |
| Duplicate tool logic | Extract shared utility |
| Complex conditionals | Replace with state machine |
| Long method | Extract smaller methods |
| Hardcoded values | Extract to configuration |

### Safe Refactoring Checklist

```markdown
□ All tests pass before refactoring
□ Make ONE structural change
□ Run tests
□ Commit
□ Repeat
```

### Example: Extract Combat Manager

**Before (in Narrator agent):**
```python
class Narrator:
    def handle_combat(self, action, enemies, character):
        initiative = self.roll_initiative(enemies, character)
        while enemies_alive(enemies) and character.hp > 0:
            for combatant in initiative:
                # 50 lines of combat logic
                ...
```

**After (extracted):**
```python
class CombatManager:
    """Single Responsibility: Combat resolution."""

    def __init__(self, dice_roller, chronicler):
        self.dice = dice_roller
        self.chronicler = chronicler

    def run_combat(self, combatants: list[Combatant]) -> CombatResult:
        initiative = self._roll_initiative(combatants)
        return self._combat_loop(initiative)

class DungeonMaster:
    def handle_combat(self, action, enemies, character):
        result = self.combat_manager.run_combat([character] + enemies)
        return self.narrate_combat_result(result)
```

## 13. Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: HTMX Over React

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need interactive UI for streaming narrative and choices.

**Decision:** Use HTMX + Jinja2 instead of React/Vue.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Simpler stack (XP: Simplicity)
- ✅ No build step for frontend
- ✅ SSE streaming works naturally
- ✅ Progressive enhancement
- ⚠️ Less ecosystem for complex UI
- ⚠️ Team must learn HTMX patterns

### ADR-002: In-Memory Session State

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Need to track adventure state per user session.

**Decision:** Use Python dict per session, no external database for MVP.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Zero infrastructure (XP: Simplicity)
- ✅ Fast reads/writes
- ⚠️ State lost on server restart
- ⚠️ No horizontal scaling (acceptable for MVP)

### ADR-003: Model Tiering

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Balance quality vs. cost for LLM calls.

**Decision:** Sonnet for narrative, Haiku for mechanics.

**Consequences:**
- ✅ ~60% cost reduction
- ✅ Faster mechanical operations
- ✅ Quality maintained where it matters
- ⚠️ Two models to maintain

---

## 15. Character Creation Flow

### Overview

The Character Interviewer agent manages the entire character creation process through a conversational interface. This approach aligns with the XP value of simplicity - players describe their character naturally instead of filling out complex forms.

```

### Session State Integration

The Character Interviewer integrates tightly with the session management system:

**During Character Creation:**
```python
# Session state structure during character creation
session_state = {
    "session_id": "uuid-v4",
    "phase": "character_creation",
    "character": {
        "name": None,              # Populated during conversation
        "race": None,              # Extracted from user input
        "class": None,             # Extracted from user input
        "backstory": "",           # Built up through questions
        "personality": {},         # Traits, ideals, bonds, flaws
        "stats": {},               # Generated at end
        "equipment": [],           # Class-appropriate starting gear
        "status": "in_progress"    # in_progress | review | complete
    },
    "conversation_history": [],    # Full dialogue for context
    "creation_step": 1             # Track progress through flow
}
```

**After Character Finalized:**
```python
# Character data becomes available to other agents
session_state = {
    "session_id": "uuid-v4",
    "phase": "quest_hook",         # Advanced to next phase
    "character": {
        "name": "Grimlock Stonefist",
        "race": "Dwarf",
        "class": "Fighter",
        "level": 1,
        "backstory": "Lost his clan to an orc raid. Seeks revenge and redemption.",
        "personality": {
            "traits": ["Grumpy but loyal", "Suspicious of strangers"],
            "ideals": "Honor and clan loyalty",
            "bonds": "Will protect the innocent",
            "flaws": "Quick to anger when orcs are mentioned"
        },
        "stats": {
            "strength": 16,
            "dexterity": 12,
            "constitution": 15,
            "intelligence": 10,
            "wisdom": 13,
            "charisma": 8
        },
        "hp": 12,
        "ac": 16,
        "equipment": ["Battleaxe", "Shield", "Chain mail"],
        "status": "complete"
    }
}
```

### Agent Handoffs

The Character Interviewer's output feeds directly into other agents:

**To Innkeeper (Quest Generation):**
- Backstory hooks: "Lost his clan to an orc raid"
- Personality traits: Guide quest tone and NPC interactions
- Character goals: Inform quest objectives

**To Narrator (Scene Description):**
- Personality traits: Adapt narrative tone
- Character background: Reference in descriptions
- Roleplaying cues: How character might react

**To Keeper (Mechanics):**
- Stats and modifiers: Used for dice rolls
- HP and AC: Combat tracking
- Equipment: Available actions and abilities

**To Jester (Complications):**
- Character flaws: Opportunities for complications
- Backstory elements: Foreshadowing material

### Character Creation Success Criteria

**BDD Scenarios Covered:**
- Character created from natural language description
- D&D 5e stats are valid and balanced
- Backstory is coherent and actionable
- Character can be modified before finalizing
- Character data persists in session

**XP Principles Applied:**
- **Simplicity:** No complex forms, just conversation
- **Feedback:** Immediate character preview and modification
- **Communication:** Natural language instead of game jargon
- **Respect:** <60s to create character and start adventure
