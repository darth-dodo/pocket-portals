## Opening

**Innkeeper Theron:**
> Fishing village called Saltmere sent a rider yesterday. Made it halfway here before his horse died. Made it to my door before he did.

> Last thing he said: "The tide came in wrong."

> Nobody who's gone to check has come back. Magistrate's paying a hundred gold for answers.

## NPCs

**Elder Maren (she/her):** Protects her village. Made a deal with something in the water, years ago.

**Finnick (he/him):** Lighthouse keeper. Counts everything. It keeps him sane.

## Scene 1: The Village

**Narrator:**
> The coast road winds along cliffs that plunge into churning gray nothing. Saltmere appears through the rain like a memory you can't quite place, and the silence hits you before the smell does.

> Doors hang open on empty hinges. Food rots on tables set for meals no one ate. The only sound is the waves, rhythmic and wrong, like breathing.

> Seventeen survivors huddle in the chapel, faces turned toward the altar where Elder Maren stands. None of them look at you when you enter.

> "You shouldn't have come," Maren says. Her voice is steady, but her hands aren't. "When the tide goes out, it takes things. Memories. Names. People. And when it comes back..."

> Somewhere outside, a child begins to sing. A song with no words.

**Keeper:**
> Keep your head. 13 to resist.

*Fail:* Your feet move before you decide. One step toward the door. Then another.

## Scene 2: The Lighthouse

**Narrator:**
> Finnick opens on the twelfth knock. His eyes skip past you, counting the stones in the path, the drops of rain on the rail, the seconds between waves.

> "The light keeps it confused," he says, fingers tapping a rhythm on the doorframe. "Keeps it from finding the shore. But the oil..." He laughs, or maybe sobs. "I keep counting. It keeps being less."

> From the lighthouse gallery, you can see the whole bay. The water looks like water. It moves like water.

> But something beneath the surface moves differently. Something with too many angles.

**Keeper:**
> Look away. 15 to manage it. Miss and it costs you. 1d4.

## Climax

**Narrator:**
> Maren finds you before dawn. The rain has stopped, and the silence presses against your ears like deep water.

> "There's a way to send it back." She holds a book that feels wet even when it's dry. "Someone has to forget. Everything. Who they are. Who they loved. All of it, fed to the tide."

> She looks toward the chapel where her people wait.

> "I made the deal. I'll pay for it. Unless you know another way."

**Player choices:**

1. Let Maren sacrifice herself
2. Find another solution
3. Try to fight it

## Epilogue

*If Maren sacrificed:*

**Narrator:**
> She walks into the water at first light, the waves parting around her like a greeting. The thing rises to meet her, and for one endless moment you see it clearly, all of it, forever.

> Then she speaks, and the world goes quiet.

> The survivors remember nothing of the past week. No one remembers Elder Maren at all. In the sand at the tideline, you find a locket with a face you don't recognize.

> You keep it anyway.

## Jester

> "Following the creepy child's voice toward dark water. This is a completely normal thing that normal people do."
