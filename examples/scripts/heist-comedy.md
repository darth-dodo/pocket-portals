## Opening

> Got a strange one. Duke Harlan humiliated a merchant named Pip at court last week. Called him a "common rat" in front of everyone.

> Pip wants revenge. Not violence. Embarrassment.

> The Duke's throwing a masked ball tomorrow. Pip wants someone to steal his pants. While he's wearing them.

> Fifty gold. Plus whatever you can pocket on the way out.

## Scene 1: The Plan

**Narrator:**
> Pip's townhouse smells of lavender and barely contained rage. Maps cover every surface, annotated in at least three colors of ink.

> "The Duke is allergic to shellfish," Pip says, tracing a finger along the manor's floor plan. "Deathly allergic. He keeps a physician nearby at all times."

> They look up, grinning. "Create a distraction. Get him alone. Take the pants. Simple."

> Three ways in: servant entrance, balcony, or through the wine cellar. The Duke's bedroom is on the second floor, but he'll be in the ballroom until midnight at least.

> How do you want to play this?

## Scene 2: The Ball

**Narrator:**
> The ballroom blazes with candlelight, a swirling sea of masks and silk and perfume expensive enough to drown in. A string quartet plays something elegant. The Duke holds court by the fountain, laughing too loudly at his own wit.

> You spot Coral weaving through the crowd with a wine tray. The physician hovers near the kitchen. Guards at every door, but their eyes are on the guests, not the servants.

**Keeper:**
> Blend in: 10. Win Coral over: 12.

*If shellfish distraction:*

**Narrator:**
> The Duke's face cycles through an impressive range of colors. Red, purple, something approaching chartreuse. Guards rush him toward a private room, the physician scrambling behind.

> You have maybe two minutes.

## Scene 3: The Pants

**Narrator:**
> The Duke sprawls across a chaise, wheezing dramatically while the physician works. Neither notices the door open. Neither notices you.

> His pants are extraordinary. Gold thread, pearl buttons, enough silk to upholster a small palace. They're also still very much on his body.

**Keeper:**
> Quick hands. 14. Or get creative.

*Success:*

**Narrator:**
> Later, you won't be able to explain exactly how you did it. Something about leverage and distraction and sheer audacity. But you're holding the Duke's pants, and he hasn't noticed yet.

*Fail:*

**Keeper:**
> Run for it. Three chances: Fast feet 12, nimble 11, vanish 10. Two out of three and you're clear.

---

## Climax

**Narrator:**
> You slip through the crowd, the world's most expensive trousers tucked under your arm. Behind you, a shriek. Then a gasp. Then laughter, building like a wave.

> The Duke stands in the ballroom doorway, searching frantically for the source of the draft.

> Everyone sees.

---

## Epilogue

**Narrator:**
> Pip pays double, giggling so hard they can barely count the coins. The story spreads through every tavern in the city before sunrise.

> The Duke never shows his face at court again.

> You still have the pants. They're hideous. They're worth a fortune.

## Jester

> "Stealing a man's pants while he's wearing them. This is peak adventuring right here."

> "The Duke's smallclothes have little crowns on them. I thought you should know that."
