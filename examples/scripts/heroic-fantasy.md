## Opening

**Innkeeper Theron:**
> Orc warband hit the valley. Three hundred strong, moving fast. They'll reach Millbrook by nightfall.

> There's one bridge over the Gorge. If someone holds it long enough for the villagers to evacuate...

> I'm not going to lie. This might be a one-way trip. But those are good people. Kids. Families.

> The garrison's a day out. You'd need to hold for maybe an hour.

> You in?

## NPCs

**Warden Kess (she/her):** Militia leader. Tough, practical. Will fight beside you.

**Old Tam (he/him):** Retired soldier. Knows the bridge. Knows he's too old, offers anyway.

**Grukk (they/them):** Orc warleader. Respects strength. Might parley if impressed.

## Scene 1: The Bridge

**Narrator:**
> The bridge spans the Gorge like a dare, twenty feet of ancient stone over three hundred feet of nothing. Wind howls up from the river below, carrying spray and the promise of a long fall.

> Kess arrives with twelve militia. Farmers holding spears they've never used, fear in their eyes and something harder underneath. They're not running.

> Old Tam rests a hand on the weathered railing. "Could collapse it," he says. "Drop the whole thing into the Gorge. But not while anyone's still on it."

> Behind you, the sounds of a village emptying. Ahead, dust rises on the horizon like a stormcloud with teeth.

## Scene 2: First Wave

**Narrator:**
> Twenty orcs crest the hill, their war cries rolling across the valley like thunder. Arrows first, dark shapes arcing against the sky. Then the charge, boots shaking the earth.

> But the bridge is narrow. They can only come three at a time.

**Keeper:**
> Waves of 3. Hold the line: 10. Push back: 12. Each miss costs one militia.

**Narrator:**
> The first orc reaches you, axe raised, mouth open in a scream that ends suddenly. Bodies tumble into the abyss. The second wave hesitates.

> Across the gap, Grukk watches. They haven't moved. They're measuring you.

---

## Scene 3: The Choice

**Narrator:**
> Third wave, and you're painting the stones red, yours and theirs. Half the militia is down or dying. But behind you, Kess signals: the villagers are almost clear.

> Grukk steps onto the bridge. Alone. The warband falls silent.

> "You fight well." Their voice carries over the wind. "My warriors speak of the demon on the bridge. I came to see for myself."

> They plant their axe in the stone. "Single combat. You win, we leave. I win, we walk over what's left of you."

> The warband waits. The militia waits. The wind waits.

**Player choices:**

1. Accept the duel
2. Refuse, keep fighting
3. Try to negotiate

## Climax

**If duel:**

**Keeper:**
> Three rounds. You swing, they swing. Best of three. Grukk's tough but fair.

**Narrator:**
> Steel meets steel over the abyss, each blow echoing off the canyon walls. Grukk is strong, faster than they look, but you've been fighting for an hour and you're still standing.

*Win:*

**Narrator:**
> Grukk falls to one knee, blood streaming from a wound they didn't see coming. They look up at you, and there's something like a smile on their face.

> "Well fought."

> The warband withdraws. The bridge holds.

---

## Epilogue

**Narrator:**
> Millbrook survives. They name a feast day after you, carve your likeness into the bridge stone, tell stories that grow taller with each telling.

> Kess finds you at the tavern a week later, slides a drink across the bar.

> "The Warden position's open," she says. "If you're tired of adventures."

> Outside, the bridge stands. It'll stand for a hundred years, they say. And they'll tell your story the whole time.

## Jester

> "One bridge. Three hundred orcs. Twelve farmers. This is fine."

> "The orc warleader just challenged you to single combat. Your left leg is bleeding pretty good. No pressure."
