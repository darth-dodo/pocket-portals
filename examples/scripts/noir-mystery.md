## SETUP PHASE (Turns 1-5)

### Opening — Turn 1

**Narrator:**
> Rain hammers the cobblestones outside, each drop catching the lamplight like falling coins. Inside the tavern, the fire has burned low, and the crowd has thinned to drunks nursing their regrets.

> The door bangs open. A woman staggers in, velvet dress torn at the shoulder, jewels at her throat worth more than this whole district. Blood on her hands, not her own.

> She scans the room. Finds you. Walks straight to your table like she's been looking for you her whole life.

> "You find things. I need you to find who killed my husband." A pouch of gold hits the table. "Before they pin it on me."

> Her eyes are steady. Too steady for a widow.

*[PACING: ESTABLISH - Classic noir opening, immediate mystery, unreliable client]*

---

### NPCs

**Lady Vestra (she/her):** Wants her name cleared. Touches her ring when lying. Knows more than she's telling.

**Inspector Crane (he/him):** Wants a quick arrest. Paid to frame her. Dangerous when cornered.

**Marcus the Fence (he/him):** Knows everyone's secrets. Trades information for favors.

---

### Scene 1: Taking the Case — Turns 2-5

**Narrator:**
> The gold is real. The widow is beautiful. The story has holes you could drive a carriage through.

> "I found him in his study," she says, each word careful as footsteps on thin ice. "We'd argued earlier. About money. About other things."

> She meets your eyes. "I didn't kill him. But I know how it looks."

> The watch patrols will have the manor sealed by morning. If you're going to investigate, it needs to be tonight.

**Player choices:**
1. Go to the manor immediately
2. Ask Lady Vestra more questions
3. Visit your contacts first

*[PACING: Establish the mystery, plant seeds of doubt]*

---

## RISING_ACTION PHASE (Turns 6-20)

### Scene 2: The Crime Scene — Turns 6-12

**Narrator:**
> The Ashford manor sits on Silk Hill where the wealthy pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist. The study smells of leather and old paper, with a new smell underneath: copper and something darker.

> Lord Ashford lies slumped over his desk, a letter opener buried between his shoulder blades. Papers scattered like fallen leaves. A half-written letter, an overturned inkwell, a window left slightly ajar.

> And there, by the door: muddy bootprints that don't match the Lord's fine shoes.

> What catches your attention first?

**Keeper:**
> Sharp eyes. DC 10 to spot the clue.

*Success:* River clay in the mud. Dockside. Letter addressed to a Magistrate, mentions "warehouse operations."

*Fail:* You find it, but knock something over. The maid notices.

*[PACING: ESCALATE - Gathering evidence, building the case]*

---

### Scene 2b: Following Threads — Turns 13-20

**Narrator:**
> Marcus the Fence meets you in his usual booth, shadow hiding half his face. "Ashford? He was into something dirty. Import business, but the manifests didn't match the cargo."

> He slides a scrap of paper across the table. A warehouse address. "Someone's been paying Inspector Crane a lot of money lately. Same someone who uses that warehouse."

> "I'd be careful, friend. People who dig into this tend to stop digging. Permanently."

**Keeper:**
> Sense motive on Marcus: DC 12. He's telling the truth—and he's scared.

*[PACING: The conspiracy widens, danger increases]*

---

## MID_POINT PHASE (Turns 21-30)

### Scene 3: The Twist — Turns 21-25

**Narrator:**
> The warehouse sits at the end of a dead-end pier, fog rolling in from the water like a living thing. Inside: crates marked as textiles, but the smell is wrong. Medicine. Expensive medicine, stolen from hospitals.

> And in the office, a ledger. Names, dates, payments. Lord Ashford's name appears dozens of times. So does Inspector Crane's.

> But the signature at the bottom of every page, authorizing every shipment?

> Lady Vestra.

*[PACING: REVEAL - The client is complicit, everything shifts]*

---

### Scene 3b: Confrontation at the Docks — Turns 26-30

**Narrator:**
> Inspector Crane materializes from the mist, badge catching what little light there is. His smile doesn't reach his eyes.

> "The widow's hired help. Interesting that you'd find your way here, of all places." He adjusts his gloves. "I'm about to arrest Lady Vestra for murder. Unless you've got something that changes my mind."

> He doesn't look like a man who wants his mind changed.

**Keeper:**
> Talk him down: DC 14. Scare him off: DC 12. Got evidence? Just DC 8.

*Success:* A dock worker steps forward. "Saw his man on that wall last night." More witnesses gather.

*Fail:* Crane's hand moves to his sword. "Wrong answer."

*[PACING: Lines drawn, confrontation inevitable]*

---

## CLIMAX PHASE (Turns 31-42)

### Scene 4: Justice — Turns 31-38

**If combat:**

**Keeper:**
> Crane. Tough. Hits hard. DC 15 to drop.

**Narrator:**
> Steel sings in the fog. Crane fights like a man with nothing to lose, because he is one. Every secret, every payment, every body—it all ends here.

*[PACING: INTENSIFY - Physical or verbal showdown, truth vs lies]*

---

### Scene 4b: The Truth — Turns 39-42

**If persuasion:**

**Narrator:**
> The witnesses close in, a wall of hard faces and harder memories. Crane's men back away, leaving him alone in the circle of lantern light.

> The evidence speaks. The ledger. The bootprints. The letter Lord Ashford was writing to the Magistrate before someone stopped him.

> Crane's smile finally dies.

*[PACING: Quest complete—truth revealed, epilogue triggers]*

---

## DENOUEMENT PHASE (Turns 43-50)

### Epilogue — Turns 43+

**Narrator:**
> Lady Vestra clears her name by week's end. The courts move fast when the evidence is this damning. Crane hangs. The warehouse burns. The medicine returns to the hospitals.

> You find her in the manor garden, staring at nothing. As you approach, she turns.

> "You know what I was," she says. It's not a question.

> "What will you do now?"

> She touches her ring. But this time, she's not lying.

> "Something better. I hope."

> You leave the gold on the table. It feels heavier now.

*[PACING: RESOLVE - Moral complexity, no clean answers, the cost of truth]*

---

## Jester Moments

*Turn 4:*
> "Taking the case from the blood-covered widow. Sure. I'll just be over here, taking notes for the inevitable inquiry."

*Turn 22:*
> "The plot twist is that everyone was lying. Truly shocking. Never saw that coming in a noir mystery."

*Turn 36:*
> "Inspector Crane is corrupt. The widow was complicit. The dead guy was dirty. Is anyone in this story NOT morally compromised?"

## Implementation Notes

**IMPORTANT**: The "Player choices:" sections in this script are for DESIGN REFERENCE only.

In the actual game:
- The Narrator generates ONLY the narrative text (scene description)
- Choices are generated SEPARATELY by a dedicated `generate_choices` call
- The Narrator should NEVER include numbered choices in their response

The scripts show what choices WOULD make sense at each point, but the narrator's job is just to set the scene and end with an action hook.

## Agent Guidelines

**Narrator Pacing Notes:**
- SETUP: Rain, shadows, cigarette smoke, immediate intrigue
- RISING: Each clue reveals more questions, paranoia builds
- MIDPOINT: The twist should recontextualize everything
- CLIMAX: Tension of confrontation, moral weight
- DENOUEMENT: Noir endings are bittersweet, truth has costs

**Keeper Notes:**
- Investigation DCs vary by approach (10-14)
- Social manipulation as valid as combat
- Evidence collection matters
- Let players piece together the conspiracy

**Jester Timing:**
- Cynical observations, genre-aware
- Appears to comment on tropes
- Never undermines genuine tension
- Dark humor fits noir tone
