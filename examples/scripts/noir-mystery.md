## Opening

**Narrator:**
> Rain hammers the cobblestones outside, each drop catching the lamplight like falling coins. Inside the tavern, the fire has burned low, and the crowd has thinned to drunks nursing their regrets.

> The door bangs open. A woman staggers in, velvet dress torn at the shoulder, jewels at her throat worth more than this whole district. Blood on her hands, not her own.

> She scans the room. Finds you. Walks straight to your table like she's been looking for you her whole life.

> "You find things. I need you to find who killed my husband." A pouch of gold hits the table. "Before they pin it on me."

> Her eyes are steady. Too steady for a widow.

## Scene 1: The Study

**Narrator:**
> The Ashford manor sits on Silk Hill where the wealthy pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist. The study smells of leather and old paper, with a new smell underneath: copper and something darker.

> Lord Ashford lies slumped over his desk, a letter opener buried between his shoulder blades. Papers scattered like fallen leaves. A half-written letter, an overturned inkwell, a window left slightly ajar.

> And there, by the door: muddy bootprints that don't match the Lord's fine shoes.

> What catches your attention first?

**Keeper:**
> Sharp eyes. 10 to spot it.

*Success:* River clay in the mud. Dockside. Letter addressed to a Magistrate, mentions "warehouse operations."

*Fail:* You find it, but knock something over. Lady Vestra notices.

## Scene 2: Confrontation

**Narrator:**
> The docks sprawl along the river like a sleeping beast, fog rolling off the water thick enough to taste. Somewhere a bell clangs, slow and mournful.

> Inspector Crane materializes from the mist, badge catching what little light there is. His smile doesn't reach his eyes.

> "The widow's hired help. Interesting that you'd find your way here, of all places." He adjusts his gloves. "I'm about to arrest Lady Vestra for murder. Unless you've got something that changes my mind."

> He doesn't look like a man who wants his mind changed.

**Keeper:**
> Talk him down: 14. Scare him off: 12. Got evidence? Just 8.

*Success:* A dock worker steps forward. "Saw his man on that wall last night." More witnesses gather.

*Fail:* Crane's hand moves to his sword. "Wrong answer."

## Climax

**If combat:**

**Keeper:**
> Crane. Tough. Hits hard. 15 to drop.

**Narrator:**
> Steel sings in the fog. Crane fights like a man with nothing to lose, because he is one.

**If persuasion:**

**Narrator:**
> The witnesses close in, a wall of hard faces and harder memories. Crane's men back away, leaving him alone in the circle of lantern light.

## Epilogue

**Narrator:**
> Lady Vestra clears her name by week's end. The courts move fast when the evidence is this damning.

> You find her in the manor garden, staring at nothing. As you turn to leave, you catch her reflection in the window glass.

> She's smiling.

## Jester

> "Taking the case from the blood-covered widow. Sure. I'll just be over here, taking notes for the inevitable inquiry."
