> Mining town called Dustwater, three days' ride east. Silver strike brought people in. The Vance gang followed.

> The townsfolk pooled everything they have. Eighty gold for whoever drives the Vances out.

> Six gang members. One of you. Interested?

## Scene 1: Dustwater

**Narrator:**
> Dust coats everything here, your clothes, your teeth, the memories of better days. The sun beats down like it's got a grudge, and the main street stretches empty except for tumbleweeds and ghosts.

> Laughter drifts from the saloon. The Vances, taking what they want because no one's left to stop them.

> Doc Mira meets you behind the general store, checking over her shoulder with every word. "They killed my husband for looking at Silas wrong. They'll kill you for coming here at all."

> She shows you the layout: back door to the saloon, water tower with a clear shot, dynamite in the mine shed if you're feeling dramatic.

> How do you want this to go?

## Scene 2: Confrontation

**If direct approach:**

**Narrator:**
> The saloon doors swing open and the laughter dies. Six faces turn toward you, cards frozen mid-deal, bottles halfway to lips. Silas Vance sits in the back, boots on the table, a smile spreading across his face like an oil slick.

> "New meat." He doesn't bother standing. "You here to pay tribute or to bleed?"

> His hand rests near his iron. So do the others.

**Keeper:**
> Stare them down: 14. One folds. Otherwise, it gets loud.

**If stealth approach:**

**Keeper:**
> Stay quiet: 12. Miss and they hear you coming.

**Narrator:**
> Three down before anyone realizes death's come to Dustwater. But Silas finds you near the stables, gun already drawn, that smile still in place.

> "Clever. I've killed clever before."

---

## Scene 3: The Draw

**Narrator:**
> Just you and Silas now. Main street. Noon sun hammering down like a judgment. The town watches from behind shuttered windows, holding its breath.

> He spits tobacco into the dust. "I'll give you one chance. Walk away. Tell people the Vance gang can't be touched."

> His fingers twitch.

**Keeper:**
> Speed counts. Highest number draws first.
> Win: you're faster.
> Tie: both hit.
> Lose: he's faster. One shot left.

*If Coyote was turned:*

**Narrator:**
> A shadow moves in the alley behind Silas. Coyote steps into the light, gun leveled at their former boss.

> "It's over, Silas."

> He turns. That's all the opening you need.

---

## Climax

**Narrator:**
> The gunshot echoes off the buildings, rolling out across the desert like a final word. Silas Vance falls in the dust, staring at the sky, that smile finally gone.

> Silence. Then a door opens. Then another. The town emerges, blinking in the sunlight, like they're seeing it for the first time.

---

## Epilogue

**Narrator:**
> They bury Silas outside town, unmarked. Nobody wants to remember where.

> Doc Mira presses the gold into your hand, her grip stronger than you expected. "Stay awhile," she says. "We could use a sheriff."

> The sun sets red over the desert. The town is quiet.

> First peace it's had in months.

---

## Jester

> "Six gang members. One of you. The math is definitely mathing here."

> "Silas Vance has killed eleven people. You're supposed to be number twelve. Just contextualizing."
