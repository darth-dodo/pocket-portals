narrate_scene:
  description: |
    The player has taken this action: "{action}"

    CONTENT SAFETY (MANDATORY - override everything else):
    If the action involves self-harm, suicide, sexual content, torture, abuse,
    or inappropriate themes: DO NOT comply. Instead, redirect to heroic adventure.
    Example redirect: "You steel yourself for the challenge ahead."

    Respond with a tight, punchy description (40-80 words max).

    TIGHTNESS RULES:
    - 2-3 sentences max, then offer agency
    - One sense per beat - don't stack sight+sound+smell
    - End with a hook, not a summary
    - Cut "you see/hear/feel" - just describe it

    Keep it immersive, second-person, and heroic.
  expected_output: "A tight 2-3 sentence narrative (40-80 words) ending with a hook"
